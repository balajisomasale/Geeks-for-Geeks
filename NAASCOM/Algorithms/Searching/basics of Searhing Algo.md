Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. A search algorithm is primarily used to retrieve information stored or calculated within a data search request.  Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:


1)Sequential Search

2) Interval Search

**Sequential Search** – In a sequential search, every element in a list is checked until the requested search item is found. 

**Interval Search** – Interval algorithms are more efficient than sequential search algorithms and breaks an array into smaller parts to be searched. However, for an interval search to be the most effective, the data needs to be sorted before searching.
