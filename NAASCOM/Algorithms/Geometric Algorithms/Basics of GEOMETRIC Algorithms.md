Geometric algorithms are more commonly known by the name Computational Geometry. These algorithms are designed to solve geometric problems and are stated in terms of geometry. Geometric algorithms require in-depth knowledge of different mathematical subjects like topology, algebra and differential geometry.  For example, topological maps, and computer-aided design and manufacturing are examples of the need for geometric algorithms.  In fact, the use of geometric algorithms dates to the building of the pyramids.  Most recently, geometric algorithms have become essential in the world or virtual and augmented reality design.


There are two main branches of computational geometry,


1.     Combinatorial


2.      Numerical

**Combinatorial Computational Geometry**



Combinatorial computational geometry is also called algorithmic geometry. The primary goal in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems in terms of basic geometrical objects such as circles, triangles polygons, etc.. Combinatorial computational geometry is used extensively in such construction areas as pyramid construction, marine construction to determine convex hull shapes, and in space craft constructions.



**Numerical computational geometry**



Numerical computational geometry (NCG) is also known as geometric modeling and computer-aided geometric design.  Because numerical geometry is used primarily in in Computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) it makes use of parametric curves and surfaces and Bezier curves and splines.
